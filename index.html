    <p>
        The current consensus model of the origins of the universe is known as lambda-CDM, where CDM stands for
        Cold Dark Matter. The foundation of the model is the Big Bang, where space-time, matter and energy came
        into being from nothing... or possibly quantum field fluctuations.

        In the 1980s, <a href="https://web.mit.edu/physics/people/faculty/guth_alan.html" target="_blank">Alan Guth</a> and others
        developed <a href="https://wmap.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/bb_cosmo_infl.html" target="_blank">Inflationary Theory</a>, which was
        designed to solve problems with the smoothness and homogeneity of the universe, and while it remains
        <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2017/09/28/is-the-inflationary-universe-a-scientific-theory-not-anymore/#51bfb90ab45e" target="_blank">controversial</a>,
        it is part of the standard model of cosmology.
